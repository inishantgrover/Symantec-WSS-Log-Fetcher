4. Ask your SIEM solution to pickup the logs from the Output folder

## Background 
After a month or so troubleshooting with the Broadcom Team, finally found out how to download the logs (lack of proper documentation). Then challenge was there was no open source script available to download the logs. Thus made one and now publishing it for everyone.
